        <p><strong>Security engineering principles</strong> include identity and access management (IAM), network segmentation, least privilege principles, cryptography, secure configuration management, and zero-trust design patterns including SASE and SSE concepts (ENISA, 2025).</p>
        
        <p><strong>AWS cloud security</strong> expertise encompasses AWS IAM, EC2 security, S3 bucket policies, CloudTrail logging, GuardDuty threat detection, Security Hub, AWS Config, VPC security, KMS encryption, and hybrid threat protection across multi-cloud environments. This specialization differentiates candidates in the job market as organizations continue migrating to cloud-first architectures (AWS, 2025).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Threat detection and incident response</strong> competencies include SIEM content development, EDR telemetry analysis, alert triage, incident scoping, containment strategies, eradication procedures, recovery processes, and post-incident improvements. <strong>Threat-informed defense</strong> capability using MITRE ATT&CK enables mapping of adversary tactics and techniques to detection controls, improving coverage and response playbooks.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Application security</strong> fundamentals encompass OWASP Top 10 risks, SDLC security touchpoints, basic code review techniques, and DevSecOps practices to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities in software systems (OWASP, 2025).</p>

        <h2 id="tools">3.2. Tools and Platforms</h2>
        <p>Industry-standard security tools across multiple categories are required. SIEM and SOAR platforms include Splunk, Elastic Stack, AWS Security Lake, and Sumo Logic. Endpoint and extended detection and response tools include CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, and Carbon Black. AWS cloud security tools include GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail, AWS Config, and Prowler. Network analysis tools include Wireshark and tcpdump. Vulnerability management tools include AWS Inspector, Nessus, Qualys, and OpenVAS. Scripting capabilities in Python and Bash for automation and AWS Lambda functions are required. Red-team tools including Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit support development of adversary perspective essential for defensive work.</p>

        <h2 id="certifications">3.3. Certification Roadmap</h2>
        <p>Certification strategy balances foundational credentials with specialized expertise.
